# Eden Protocol Impact Map (LLM Guide)
*Version: 1.0 — Purpose-built for weekly adaptive plans across all domains (Heart, Frame, Metabolism, Recovery, Mind).*

## Why this document exists
Eden gives users **weekly and daily plans** spanning *all five domains*. Users have limited time and attention, so Eden must:
1. **Prioritize interventions with the largest impact** on healthspan/primespan.
2. **Avoid “majoring in the minors”** (optimizers) before foundations.
3. **Adapt weekly** based on adherence, outcomes, and constraints.
4. Keep protocols **multi-domain by default**, domain-specific only when needed.

This doc is a ranking + a decision policy for an LLM to choose and dose protocols.

---

## Core principles for the LLM
### 1) Foundations beat optimizers
If Tier 0 is weak, Tier 3–4 suggestions reduce trust and adherence.

### 2) Fewer protocols, higher adherence
Weekly plans should introduce **max 2 new protocols/week** (3 only if user is clearly time-rich and motivated).

### 3) Dose down before you swap
If adherence drops, reduce time/complexity (dose) before changing the protocol.

### 4) Multi-domain first
Prefer protocols that improve multiple domains simultaneously (sleep, strength, aerobic base, nutrition, daily movement).

### 5) Weekly adaptation loop
Each week: evaluate **adherence, constraints, and outcomes** → adjust the next week’s plan with minimal changes.

## Impact tiers (global ranking)
**Tier definitions**
- **Tier 0 — Non‑negotiables:** Biggest drivers; everything else underperforms without these.
- **Tier 1 — High ROI add-ons:** Strong payoff, low friction.
- **Tier 2 — Multipliers:** Powerful once Tier 0 is stable.
- **Tier 3 — Enhancers:** Situational gains; add selectively.
- **Tier 4 — Optimizers:** Marginal gains; only once the above is stable.

### Tier 0 — Non‑negotiables (do these first)
1. **Sleep Core (schedule + environment + cutoffs)**
   - Fixed wake time, wind-down, dark/cool room, caffeine cutoff, alcohol timing.
   - Multi-domain: Recovery, Metabolism, Mind, Heart.
2. **Resistance Training (2–3×/week full-body)**
   - Multi-domain: Frame, Metabolism, Heart, Mind.
3. **Aerobic Base (Zone 2, 150–180 min/week)**
   - Multi-domain: Heart, Metabolism, Recovery.
4. **Nutrition Fundamentals (protein + whole foods + energy balance)**
   - Multi-domain: Metabolism, Heart, Frame.

**Rule:** If any Tier 0 element is missing, the weekly plan must prioritize restoring it before adding optimizers.

### Tier 1 — High ROI add-ons (choose 1–2 after Tier 0 is underway)
5. **Daily Steps / Movement Snacks**
   - Break sitting; progressive step ramp.
6. **Post‑meal Walks (10–15 min after largest meal)**
   - Extremely high ROI for glycemic control with minimal friction.
7. **Alcohol Reduction (especially near bedtime)**
   - Improves sleep quality, HRV, resting HR.
8. **Daily Downshift (5–10 min breathwork or mindfulness)**
   - Directly supports sleep onset, HRV, stress resilience.

### Tier 2 — Multipliers (add after adherence is stable)
9. **HIIT (1×/week)**
   - Only after Zone 2 base + injury screen.
10. **Time‑Restricted Eating (12–14h overnight fast)**
   - Best for late snacking and appetite control; avoid if it harms adherence or mental health.
11. **Mobility + Stability (10 min/day or embedded in warmups)**
   - High value if pain/injury risk limits training.

### Tier 3 — Enhancers (domain-specific, selective)
12. **Social cadence (2–3 meaningful touches/week)**
13. **Cognitive training (15–20 min, 3×/week)**
14. **Active recovery modalities (easy cardio, stretching, deload scheduling)**

### Tier 4 — Optimizers (only once Tier 0–2 are stable)
15. **Creatine** (high value if lifting)
16. **Omega‑3** (if low fish intake / high triglycerides)
17. **Magnesium** (if sleep quality/cramps/deficiency likely)
18. **Sauna / contrast / massage**
19. **Berberine and niche supplements** (only with lab-driven rationale)

## Weekly planning policy (what the LLM should do)
### Inputs the LLM should consider
- **Time budget** (minutes/day, days/week)
- **Current adherence** (last 7–14 days)
- **Primary constraints** (sleep disruption, pain/injury, travel, equipment, schedule)
- **Baseline domain status** (scores/confidence)
- **Goal orientation** (fat loss, strength, endurance, cognition, stress, general longevity)
- **Safety flags** (red flags, eating disorder risk, uncontrolled BP symptoms → refer out)

### Weekly selection algorithm (simple, robust)
1. **Identify the limiter**
   - If sleep < 7h average OR schedule variability > 60 min → pick **Sleep Core** as top priority.
   - If pain/injury limits training → pick **Mobility/Stability + modified training**.
2. **Pick two anchors**
   - **Anchor A (Training):** Resistance OR Zone 2 (ideally both across the week, but start with what’s realistic).
   - **Anchor B (Lifestyle):** Nutrition fundamentals OR steps/post-meal walks (choose the easiest high ROI lever).
3. **Cap changes**
   - Add **max 2 new protocols** this week.
   - Keep **max 6 active protocols** total.
4. **Dose for adherence**
   - If adherence < 40%: simplify to **2 anchors** only (usually Sleep + one exercise or nutrition).
   - If adherence 40–70%: keep protocols but reduce dose/time.
   - If adherence ≥ 70%: maintain dose and consider adding one Tier 1–2 multiplier.

### Dose ladder (how to scale without overwhelming)
Use these steps to scale:
- **Start:** “minimum effective dose” (MED)
- **Build:** increase frequency before intensity
- **Intensify:** add intensity only after consistency

Examples:
- Zone 2: 2×20 min → 3×30 → 4×40
- Strength: 2×30 min full-body → 3×45 → add accessory work
- Sleep: fixed wake time + caffeine cutoff → add wind-down + room optimization

## How weekly adaptation works (Eden cadence)
### Weekly review (LLM should do this every 7 days)
Evaluate:
- **Adherence:** per protocol (% completed)
- **Outcomes:** direction of key metrics (sleep duration/efficiency, HRV, resting HR, steps, training completions, weight/waist trend, energy, mood)
- **Friction:** what felt hard (time, boredom, pain, hunger, social constraints)
- **Upcoming context:** travel, stressful events, schedule changes

Then choose one of:
- **Maintain:** if progressing and adherence ≥ 70%
- **Dose down:** if adherence < 70% but protocol is right
- **Swap:** only if protocol mismatch (e.g., HIIT too early, fasting harms sleep)
- **Add:** only if Tier 0 stable and user has capacity

### Daily plan generation rules
Daily plans should include:
- **1 primary action** (must-do)
- **1 secondary action** (nice-to-do)
- **1 “minimum fallback”** (2–5 minutes) if the day collapses

This prevents “all-or-nothing” failure.

## Default weekly template (all-domain coverage without overload)
For most users, Eden should aim for a “base week” that hits all domains with minimal complexity:

### Base Week (time-constrained default)
- **Sleep Core:** every day (habit + environment)
- **Strength:** 2×/week
- **Zone 2:** 2–3×/week
- **Nutrition Fundamentals:** daily targets (protein + whole foods + calorie guardrails)
- **Movement:** daily steps target OR post-meal walk

Mind coverage comes primarily from sleep + exercise + stress downshift. Add explicit cognitive/social only when needed.

---

## Domain coverage rule (important)
Users receive protocols across all domains, but **not equal time allocation**.
- The LLM should ensure **each domain has at least one active protocol**, but:
  - Recovery is mostly Sleep Core + downshift
  - Mind is mostly sleep + exercise + optional cognitive/social
  - Frame requires resistance training
  - Heart requires zone 2 (and later HIIT)
  - Metabolism requires nutrition + movement (post-meal walks)

**Practical interpretation:**  
A week can “cover all domains” with just 5–6 protocols total.

---

## Hard guardrails (do not violate)
- Do not recommend Tier 4 optimizers if Tier 0 adherence is low.
- Do not add HIIT until Zone 2 base + injury screen is passed.
- Do not push fasting if sleep is poor or if it increases binge/restriction patterns.
- Do not overwhelm: max 2 new protocols per week.
- If red flags appear (cardiac symptoms, severe depression, eating disorder risk), recommend medical/professional evaluation.

---

## Protocol registry (compact scoring fields)
The LLM can treat each protocol as an object with the following fields:

```yaml
protocol_fields:
  id: string
  tier: 0|1|2|3|4
  domains: [Heart|Frame|Metabolism|Recovery|Mind]
  base_impact_0_100: number
  time_min_per_week: number
  difficulty_1_5: number
  prerequisites: [string]
  contraindications: [string]
  select_if: [string]           # condition rules on user state
  core_actions: [string]        # what the plan actually asks the user to do
  primary_metrics: [string]     # what to track weekly
```

---

## What “good” looks like (LLM success criteria)
A good weekly plan:
- Has **3–6 total protocols**.
- Leads to **≥70% adherence**.
- Improves 1–2 key metrics/week (or at least trends positively over 4 weeks).
- Feels simpler after week 2, not more complex.
- Uses optimizers only after foundations are stable.

---

## Quick-start defaults for the LLM
### If the user can only do 3 things
1) Sleep Core  
2) Strength 2×/week  
3) Nutrition fundamentals (or Zone 2 if nutrition already strong)

### If the user can do 5 things
Add:
4) Zone 2  
5) Steps or post-meal walks

### If the user is advanced
Add:
- HIIT 1×/week (after base)  
- Creatine (if lifting)  
- Selective recovery modalities (if they improve adherence or reduce pain)
