# Eden Longevity Metrics Framework

## The Primespan Promise

> "Improve your longevity biomarkers in 12 weeks"

Eden tracks metrics across three tiers, from immediately actionable to deep diagnostic. The 12-week transformation promise focuses on Tier 1 metrics that users can measure at home and improve through lifestyle changes.

---

## Tier 1: Core Metrics (Eden Actively Improves)

**These are the metrics Eden's weekly protocols directly target. Measurable without labs, improvable in 12 weeks.**

| Metric | Why It Matters | How to Measure | 12-Week Target | Eden's Lever |
|--------|---------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| **VO2max** | #1 predictor of all-cause mortality. Every 1 MET increase = 10-15% lower mortality risk. | Apple Watch estimate, or 1-mile walk test | +10-15% | Zone 2 cardio (150+ min/week) |
| **Resting Heart Rate** | Lower RHR = more efficient heart, better cardiovascular health. | Apple Health, or manual (morning, seated) | -5 to -10 bpm | Consistent cardio, stress reduction |
| **Sleep Quality** | Poor sleep linked to cognitive decline, metabolic dysfunction, shortened lifespan. | Apple Health sleep tracking, or self-report (1-10) | +2 points | Sleep hygiene protocols, consistent schedule |
| **Body Composition** | Excess visceral fat = inflammation, insulin resistance, CV risk. Muscle mass protects against frailty. | Weight + progress photos, or smart scale estimate | -3-5% body fat, +1-2kg lean mass | Resistance training + nutrition |
| **Functional Strength** | Grip strength and leg strength are independent predictors of longevity. Low strength = higher mortality. | Pushup count, squat count, grip dynamometer | +30-50% improvement | Progressive resistance training |

### Tier 1 Summary

These 5 metrics form the **Core Longevity Dashboard**. If a user improves all 5 over 12 weeks, they have meaningfully improved their healthspan trajectory.

**The Promise:** "Follow Eden for 12 weeks and see measurable improvement in all 5 core longevity metrics."

## Tier 2: Wearable Metrics (Eden Monitors)

**Helpful for optimization and tracking. Shows deeper physiological adaptation.**

| Metric | Why It Matters | How to Measure | What Improvement Looks Like | Eden's Lever |
|--------|---------------|----------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)** | Higher HRV = better stress resilience, recovery capacity, autonomic balance. | Apple Watch, Oura, Whoop | +10-20% baseline increase | Recovery protocols, sleep, stress management |
| **Sleep Stages** | Deep sleep = physical recovery. REM = cognitive consolidation. | Apple Watch, Oura | More deep sleep minutes | Sleep timing, alcohol reduction, temperature |
| **Active Minutes / Zone Minutes** | Time in elevated heart rate zones correlates with cardiovascular benefits. | Any fitness tracker | 150+ min/week moderate, 75+ vigorous | Activity prompts, cardio scheduling |
| **Step Count** | Independent predictor of mortality. 7,000+ steps/day significantly reduces risk. | Phone or watch | Consistent 7,000-10,000/day | Walking prompts, movement breaks |
| **Recovery Score** | Composite of HRV, sleep, RHR. Indicates readiness for training. | Whoop, Oura | More "green" days | Load management, recovery days |

### Tier 2 Summary

These metrics provide **optimization signals**. They help Eden adapt recommendations (e.g., "Your HRV is low today - let's do recovery instead of HIIT").

**Not promised in 12-week transformation**, but tracked for users with wearables.

## Tier 3: Lab Metrics (Eden Tracks & Educates)

**Require blood tests. Change slowly (3-6+ months). Sometimes need medical intervention. Eden can suggest lifestyle modifications but cannot guarantee improvement.**

### Cardiovascular Risk

| Metric | Why It Matters | Optimal Range | How Often to Test | Eden Can Suggest |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **ApoB** | Best predictor of cardiovascular disease. Measures atherogenic particles. | <60 mg/dL (ideal), <80 mg/dL (good) | Annually, or 3-6 months if improving | Reduce saturated fat, increase fiber, exercise |
| **Lp(a)** | Genetic CV risk factor. Largely unchangeable with lifestyle. | <30 mg/dL | Once (genetic) | Awareness, inform doctor |
| **LDL-C** | Traditional cholesterol marker. Less predictive than ApoB but commonly tested. | <100 mg/dL | Annually | Diet modifications, exercise |
| **HDL-C** | "Good" cholesterol. Higher is generally better. | >50 mg/dL (men), >60 mg/dL (women) | Annually | Exercise, reduce trans fats |
| **Triglycerides** | Marker of metabolic health. Responds well to lifestyle. | <100 mg/dL | Annually | Reduce refined carbs, alcohol, increase omega-3 |

### Metabolic Health

| Metric | Why It Matters | Optimal Range | How Often to Test | Eden Can Suggest |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Fasting Glucose** | Elevated = insulin resistance, diabetes risk. | <90 mg/dL | Annually, or with CGM | Carb timing, post-meal walks, resistance training |
| **Fasting Insulin** | Early indicator of metabolic dysfunction. Often elevated before glucose rises. | <5 μU/mL | Annually | Same as glucose |
| **HbA1c** | 3-month average of blood sugar. Gold standard for metabolic health. | <5.4% (optimal), <5.7% (good) | Every 3-6 months | Lifestyle interventions |
| **HOMA-IR** | Calculated insulin resistance score from glucose + insulin. | <1.0 | With fasting glucose/insulin | Comprehensive metabolic approach |

### Inflammation & Other

| Metric | Why It Matters | Optimal Range | How Often to Test | Eden Can Suggest |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **hsCRP** | High-sensitivity inflammation marker. Elevated = systemic inflammation. | <1.0 mg/L (optimal), <3.0 (acceptable) | Annually | Anti-inflammatory diet, exercise, sleep, stress |
| **Homocysteine** | Elevated linked to CV disease and cognitive decline. | <10 μmol/L | Annually | B vitamins, folate |
| **Vitamin D** | Deficiency linked to immune dysfunction, bone loss, mood. | 40-60 ng/mL | Annually | Supplementation, sun exposure |
| **Ferritin** | Iron storage. Too high or too low is problematic. | 50-150 ng/mL (varies by sex) | Annually | Diet modification or medical referral |
| **Testosterone (men)** | Affects muscle, energy, mood, metabolic health. | 500-900 ng/dL (total) | If symptomatic | Sleep, stress, body fat reduction, resistance training |
| **Thyroid (TSH)** | Metabolic regulation. | 0.5-2.5 mIU/L | If symptomatic | Medical referral if abnormal |

### Tier 3 Summary

These metrics represent the **deep diagnostic layer**. Eden can:
- Explain why each metric matters
- Track results over time when users upload labs
- Suggest lifestyle interventions that may help
- Celebrate improvements
- Recommend when to retest
- Suggest medical consultation when appropriate

**What Eden cannot do:**
- Guarantee lab improvements
- Replace medical advice
- Prescribe medications or supplements for medical conditions

## The Eden Transformation: Week 0 → Week 12

### Baseline Capture (Week 0)

**Tier 1 (Required):**
- Weight
- Resting heart rate
- Sleep quality self-rating (1-10)
- Pushup max
- VO2max estimate (if Apple Watch) or walk test baseline

**Tier 2 (If available):**
- Connect Apple Health / wearable
- HRV baseline

**Tier 3 (Optional):**
- Upload recent labs if available

### Check-ins (Week 4, 8, 12)

Eden prompts user to re-measure Tier 1 metrics and shows progress:

```
Week 12 Results
═══════════════

TIER 1: CORE LONGEVITY METRICS

VO2max:          32 → 37 mL/kg/min    ↑15%  ✓
Resting HR:      72 → 64 bpm          ↓8    ✓
Sleep Quality:   5/10 → 8/10          ↑3    ✓
Body Comp:       24% → 20% BF (est)   ↓4%   ✓
Strength:        8 → 18 pushups       ↑125% ✓

"Based on longevity research, these improvements
correlate with significantly increased healthspan."
```

## Key Takeaways

1. **Tier 1 is the promise.** Eden guarantees improvement in these 5 metrics for users who follow the program.

2. **Tier 2 enhances the experience.** Users with wearables get more personalized recommendations and deeper tracking.

3. **Tier 3 is the longevity credibility.** Lab tracking shows Eden is serious about longevity, not just fitness. But it's not part of the 12-week promise.

4. **The framing:** "Eden improves your core longevity metrics in 12 weeks. For the full picture, track your labs too."
